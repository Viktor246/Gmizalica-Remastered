		This masterpiece of a web application was made by: Viktor Antunovic, Marin Frankic and Filip Kapetanovic, <br>
		as a project for the web application development course on the University of tehnical studies in Rijeka. <br>
		<br>
		<br>
		This web application is our spin on the widely popular, classic game of Snake. <br>
		Test your snake skills and compete with others and unlock different background and snake colors. <br>
		<br>
		<br>
		Disclaimer: you unlock background colors every 1500 points on your total score, and you unlock different snake colors every 150 on your highscore.
